I need you to fix all responsive design and UI interactivity problems across the entire Hotel Management System. Please execute all steps straight through without pausing for confirmation:

1. GLOBAL RESPONSIVENESS
   - Audit every page (dashboard, settings, rooms, reservations, staff, policy pages, detail views) in mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
   - Ensure all layouts use fluid/grid styles so components resize and reflow correctly.
   - Fix any overflow, clipping, or misaligned elements in headers, cards, forms, tables, and modals.

2. SIDEBAR AND NAVIGATION
   - Make the responsive sidebar toggle button work on all screen sizes.
   - Ensure the sidebar expands/collapses smoothly and all links are clickable in collapsed and expanded states.
   - Fix any z-index, padding, or overflow issues that prevent sidebar items from being tapped on touch devices.

3. DARK/LIGHT MODE TOGGLE
   - Restore the dark mode/light mode toggle functionality.
   - Ensure the toggle button responds to clicks or taps in all viewports.
   - Persist the user’s theme choice in localStorage and apply it on page load.
   - Fix any CSS variables or theme context issues causing inconsistent styling.

4. BUTTONS, LINKS, AND CLICK HANDLERS
   - Verify every interactive element (buttons, links, cards, icons) has an onClick or onPress handler and proper hover/focus states.
   - Fix any missing cursor pointers, tabindex issues, or event propagation problems.
   - Add visual feedback (ripple, highlight, or opacity change) on button presses and link taps.

5. UI GLITCHES AND VISUAL CONSISTENCY
   - Standardize spacing, font sizes, and colors across all components using your design tokens or Tailwind classes.
   - Fix any duplicated IDs, misnamed classes, or leftover debug styling.
   - Ensure modals and dropdowns center correctly and scroll within the viewport if content is long.

6. TEST AND VALIDATE
   - Test on three breakpoints: 375×667 (mobile), 768×1024 (tablet), 1440×900 (desktop).
   - Log any remaining issues to console with clear labels (e.g. “RESPONSIVE BUG: …”).
   - After finishing all fixes, provide a summary of changes and confirm that all pages are now fully responsive and interactive.

Use the existing component structure and styling conventions. Do not introduce new external libraries. Deliver the complete code for each fix in one pass—no mid-process confirmations.
