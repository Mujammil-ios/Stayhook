I need you to fix several UI issues and add new navigation flows in our Hotel Management System. Please execute all steps straight through without pausing:

1. MOBILE SIDEBAR TOGGLE  
   - On mobile, the sidebar icon currently causes a screen “flinch” but never shows the menu.  
   - Implement a proper slide-in/out animation for the sidebar using Tailwind’s transition and transform utilities.  
   - Ensure the sidebar becomes fully visible at small breakpoints (≤640px) when the hamburger icon is tapped, and hides when tapping outside or on the close icon.  
   - Fix any z-index or overflow issues so that the menu overlays content correctly.

2. FOOTER LINKS  
   - In the site footer, add two links: “Terms & Conditions” and “Privacy Policy”.  
   - Link them to the existing pages `/terms-and-conditions` and `/privacy-policy`.  
   - Style the links consistently with other footer items and ensure they’re tappable on mobile.

3. DASHBOARD “VIEW ALL” PAGES  
   - In the dashboard header or summary cards, you have “View All Room Types” and “View All Recent Bookings”.  
   - Make each “View All” button/link navigate to a new full-screen page:  
     - `/room-types` – displays a list of all room types with basic filters (type, price range).  
     - `/recent-bookings` – displays a list of recent bookings sortable by date and searchable by guest name.  
   - On those pages, fetch or mock the data and render it in a responsive table or card list.  
   - Add a back button or breadcrumb to return to the dashboard.

4. IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS  
   - Use existing project routes, component patterns, and Tailwind classes.  
   - Ensure all new links/buttons have hover/focus states and are fully keyboard-accessible.  
   - Test on mobile (375×667), tablet (768×1024), and desktop (1440×900) to confirm the sidebar, footer links, and “View All” pages work correctly.  
   - Do not introduce new external libraries; build on the current codebase.

Deliver the complete code changes for each item—sidebar toggle, footer, and “View All” pages—in a single batch without mid-process confirmations.
